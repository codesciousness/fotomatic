This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Path. As part of the CSS Documentation and Debugging tutorial we were required to fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. We downloaded the broken code and the design spec, and also were provided a working version of the final product to reference. To fix Fotomatic’s bugs, we utilized Chrome DevTools and other resources to help decipher and correct the site’s CSS code.
